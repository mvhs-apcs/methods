#
# > Parameters 
# ------------
#   * a_smiling   - true only if monkey a is smiling
#   * b_smiling   - true only if monkey b is smiling
#
# TODO - write monkey_trouble?


# sum_double
#
# Given two int values, return their sum. Unless the two values are the same,
# then return double their sum. 
#
# > Parameters 
# ------------
#   * a - an integer
#   * b - an integer
#
# TODO - write sum_double




# *****************************************************
#
#   Testing
#
#     Write the three methods below, but this time the
#     tests are not given to you, so write those first.
#
# *****************************************************


# blackjack
#
# Given 2 int values greater than 0, return whichever value is nearest to 21 
# without going over. Return 0 if they both go over.
#
# > Parameters 
# ------------
#   * a - an integer
#   * b - an integer
#
# TODO - write blackjack (tests first)


# n_twice
#
# Given a string and an int n, return a string made of the first and last n 
# chars from the string.
#
# Hint | Use string.slice
#      | http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html#method-i-slice
#
# > Parameters 
# ------------
#   * str - a string with length at least n
#   * n   - an integer
#
# TODO - write n_twice (tests first)


# close_far
#
# Given three ints, a b c, return true if one of b or c is "close" (differing 
# from a by at most 1), while the other is "far", differing from both other 
# values by 2 or more. Note: n.abs computes the absolute value of number n.
#
# > Parameters 
# ------------
#   * a - an integer
#   * b - an integer
#   * c - an integer
#
# TODO - write close_far (tests first)
